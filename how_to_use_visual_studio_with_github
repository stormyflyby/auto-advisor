Setting up git with your GitHub account:

First, you'll need to download git to your device.
Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download and install the appropriate version of git.
Next, download and install GitHub CLI at https://cli.github.com.
Open the command line.
Type "gh auth login".
Select the appropriate options for the prompts (GitHub.com, HTTPS, Y, Login with a web browser).
Press enter to follow the link and enter the given code to authenticate your account.
You're all set!



Getting the project onto your device:

Open the command line.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone a repository.
Type the command "git clone [repository_url]" (https://github.com/stormyflyby/auto-advisor for main branch, branch-specific URL for other branches;
  square brackets not to be included in command).
A new directory will appear in your current directory. Open it up and work on the project!



Passing changes back to GitHub:

Open the command line.
Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
Type "git status" to see all the files that have been changed.
For each changed file, type "git add ." (or "git add [file_name]" to only add specific files)
Type "git commit -m "Your commit message here"" to send a commit to GitHub.
To push the changes, type "git push origin [branch_name]".
The changes should now be on GitHub.
If you wish, you can delete the cloned repository from your device to more easily clone it again in the future.
