This course focuses on the way in which the identity of God as Father, Son and Holy Spirit sharpens our understanding of the coherence of the Bible, the purpose for creation (and by extension humans), the meaning of salvation, the place of work, and the basis for ethics.  Special attention is given to sustained analysis of biblical texts, attending to the way in which the biblical witness integrates theology and ethics, faith and work, worship and discipleship."
