Removed functionality (planned for future updates):
- Search feature
- Filter feature
- GPA display
- Dynamic connection to LETU course databases
- Access to myLETU accounts

Added functionality:
- An option for the user to select whether they are an honors student
- A display of the user's total hours taken and still needed
- A box at the top of the main page showing what classes are recommended to be taken in the selected semester

Changed functionality:
- User enters next semester # instead of academic rank
- To declutter the interface, prerequisites are now only visible on the details page for each class instead of the main page
- Classes are grouped by type (theology, cognate, etc.) instead of displayed all together
